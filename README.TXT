TechSupport - the DodgySoft Technical support system.

This project is part of the material for the book

This project is discussed in chapter 6.


This project implements a technical support system for customers of the 
DodgySoft software company. Users can describe their software problems and 
get advice instantly!

The idea is based on Eliza - a famous program described by Joseph Weizenbaum 
in 1966. (Do a web search for "Eliza" and "Weizenbaum" if you want to know 
more about this.)

In fact, it is much more primitive than Eliza. But that's enough to match the 
quality of many software companies' technical support advice...  ;-)

To start this program, create a SupportSystem object and execute the "start" 
method.

Then start describing your problem by typing in the terminal window.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate and study library classes, such 
as ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and Random.



Questions:

43.putIfAbsent(key, value) in HashMap only inserts the key-value pair if the
   key is not already present. If the key exists, the value remains unchanged.
   This is different from put, which overwrites the value if the key already exists.
   
46.Yes it is accurate and complete. The useful parts include method signiture, parameters description and overall
   class summaries
   
47.@author: specifies the class author.
   @version: specifies the class version.
   @param: describes a parameter.
   @return: describes the return value.
   
48.@throws or @exception: documents exceptions a method may throw.
   @deprecated: marks a class or method as obsolete.
   @see: links to related classes or methods.
   {@link ClassName#method}: creates clickable inline links.
   {@code text}: formats text as inline code.
